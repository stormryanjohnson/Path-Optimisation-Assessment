For a future endurance trail, the following additional information should be requested from the client:
    
    1. Participant fitness levels and walking speeds.
    2. Weather conditions, including temperature and humidity.
    3. Terrain information, such as soil type and significant obstacles and/or areas to avoid.
    4. Data on potential water sources and resting points.

With this information, we would have to include additional constraints on the path, which would involve 
ensuring that the path does not exceed a certain maximum length, that it avoids any dangerous or inaccessible 
areas, and that it passes certain suitable locations for resting. Overall, these additional inclusions will 
ensure a challenging but safe endurance trail.
